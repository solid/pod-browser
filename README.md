# Installation

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev` to run a dev server, or `npm run build` to compile static html
  and other assets.

# Development

* PodBrowser uses a framework called [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), which has
  [extensive documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started). It uses
  [React](https://reactjs.org/) for client-side templates, [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for building assets, and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for tests.
* Any environment variables you wish to expose must be added to next.config.js.


# Deployment

You can use `npm deploy` to deploy a PodBrowser instance to Vercel, if you
create an account. Alternatively, you can:

* Run `npm run build` and `npm run start` to run the node server;
* Run `npm run build` and `npm run export` to export static HTML and assets
  to host on the server of your choice.
